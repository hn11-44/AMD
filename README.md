Abstract

The purpose of this project highlights the use of Apriori algorithm in finding association with positive interest from the skills that we find in job listings. Our analysis was based on a sample of LinkedIn 2024 containing a total of about 1.3 million jobs. We relied on Spark to run our algorithm on our sample and found that the most frequent skills listed are predominantly soft skills. This coincides with the reality as most of the white collar jobs require soft skills regardless of the industry. We used a 10\% as a threshold and observed  teamwork $\rightarrow$ communication), (leadership $\rightarrow$ communication) and (customer service $\rightarrow$ communication) have confidence greater than 0.5 along with a positive interest
